# class-grading-system

This is a class grading system that I made as a lab assignment!

The program can:
1.	add students to the class
2.	edit students in the class
3.	delete students from the class
4.	print the classâ€™s grades
5.	save students into a .csv file
6.	load students from a .csv

All user input uses error checking so the program doesn't crash (or at least I couldn't crash it.)
The grades can be opened in Excel from the .csv but a file saved in Excel will not open in the class grading system.
I have included the executable if you would like to check it out, at BCIT student numbers are formatted as A00###### and the program will only accept this format.
